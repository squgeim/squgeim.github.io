Code review is much more than making sure lint rules are kept in check. In this podcast, Aviskar engages with Romit Amgai, Pratik Karki, and Shreya Dahal to discuss their approach on effective code reviews. They also share their mindset while reviewing code, their experiences, and how it has helped them to grow as professional developers.
