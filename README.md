Just a simple personal site to introduce myself and consolidate all my blogs on various platforms.

## How it works

The contents of the site (the list of blogs and their blurbs) are in `content/blog.json`. `js/blogContents.js` fetches this json file on load and generates the view. Nothing fancy, just plain old javascript.
