				The best way to describe myself would be to call me a nerd/geek: I love computers,
technology and sciences; I don't socialize well, suck at sports, and in general
being "cool." 
</p>
<p>

I got into the computer scene at the age of 10 and soon caught interested in
programming and web-development. I also got a glimpse of linux and got hooked.
</p>
<p>

I have been experimenting with and learning a lot of things since then: 
Photoshop, Flash, Visual Basic, hacking Windows XP, and Linux.
I have been developing for the Web eversince I found it, slowly learning HTML,
CSS, Javascript and PHP, through practice and trial and error.
</p>
<p>
Most of my projects from back then were for learning purposes and didn't see the
light of day. This is something that happens to me still. Every project I start
is mostly fired by curiosity to learn something specific and after I've mastered
that the project is usually abandoned (note that this is only for my personal 
projects ;)).
</p>
<p>
Although most of my project background consists of web-development, I do not
want to become a professional web-developer. I have, for some years now, fallen
absolutely and hopelessly in love with Linux, and that is where I want my career
to be. I dream of becomming a kernel developer. I am an avid FOSS enthusiast.
</p>
<p>
In my free time I usually watch movies and series or read novels. I like science
fiction, fantacy, mistery, and everything nerdy. Some of my favorite series are
Game of Thrones, Doctor Who, Sherlock and Cosmos. I also like sitcoms like 
Friends and The Big Bang Theory.<br>
Some of the authors I love are H. G. Wells, Jules Verne, Gabriel Gracias Marquez
, J. K. Rowling, G. R. R. Martin, John Green.<br>
I don't think it's possible to list all my 
favorite movies here :).<br>
My musical taste is difficult to explain: if I like it, I like it.<br>
I also spend an aweful lot of time on YouTube. I watch Vsauce, MinutePhysics,
MinuterEarth, CGP Grey, Smarter Every Day, Numberphile, Computerphile, Sixty 
Symbols, SciShow, Crash Course, vlogbrothers, et al.
</p>
<p>
I do not play any sports, the only sport I understand is Football (the gameplay,
not the whole happenings in the European football clubs). I never really got into
Computer Games, so the only games I play now are the one in my phone.
