				<ul>
					<li>Born in December, 1993.</li>
					<li>From Kathmandu, Nepal.</li>
					<li>Studying Computer Engineering at <a href="http://keckist.edu.np" target="_blank">Kathmandu Engineering College</a>.</li>

					Hello. I am a regular geek from Nepal. I love to work on the computer and everything 
					about it. I have been into web-development since I was 10. One good/bad 
					thing about me is that I usually do not publish anything untill it is perfect 
					(it's a good excuse for so many of my unpublished projects ;)).<br>
					I am more interested in web-programming, or any kind of programming than designing.
				</p>
				<p>
					My primary source of knowledge is practice, so when I am working on my personal 
					projects my primary focus is on learning than actually completing the project. You 
					always hear the advice to never re-invent the wheel, but I believe we can not actually
					master anything if we don't do everything from scratch (as far as practicable). So when 
					I'm working on any personal project I usually do not use any of other people's code. 
					Oviously, I learned this strategy fails for any real project, but I still hang on to this
					when I'm learning something new.
				</p>
				<p>
					In my free time I like reading fiction (young adult, contemporary, fantasy, science 
					fiction, etc) and watching movies and sitcoms. I'm a big Harry Potter fan, and 
					more recently I've taken up A Game of Thrones and Doctor Who. Some of my favorite sitcoms are
					Friends, The Big Bang Theory, How I Met Your Mother, Castle. I usually like all 
					kind of movies, with an exception for anything with zombies (I don't get why people 
					are so crazy about them!).<br>
					My musical taste is difficult to define. I don't know what kind of music I like, if 
					I like it, I like it. But I know what I definately don't like: metal.
				</p>
				<p>
					I spend a lot of time on YouTube. I mostly watch the YouTube Edu channels, especially 
					vSause, minutephysics/minuteearth, Veritasium, Vlogbrothers, and all of Brady's channels.
				</p> 
				<p>
					I don't play any kind of sports. The only sport I understand is Football (soccer).<br>
					I stoped playing Computer Games a long time ago. The only games I play now are the ones 
					in my phone.
				</p>
				<p>
					...and that's about everything one needs to know about me.
